    -> What is Polymorphism in C++ programming ?
        -> One name and multiple forms.
        -> eg. Function overloading, operator overloading.
        -> eg. Virtual function.

    -> Polymorphism in C++ can be two types.
        1. Compile time polymorphism.
            Compile time polymorphism in C++ achieved using:
            1.1-> Function overloading.
            1.2-> Operator overloading.
    
        2. Run time polymorphism.
            Run time polymorphism in C++ is achieved using:
            2.1-> Virtual functions.
