Notes: 
    What is STL -> Standard Template Library in C++ programming ?
    -> It has Generic Classes and Functions.
    -> STL is used because it's a good idea not to Reinvent the wheel.
    
    Why use STL ?
    -> We can use : Well tested components.
        -> becuase of Time saving.
    
    Components of STL.
        1. Containers
        2. Algorithms.
        3. Iterators.

    1. Containers.
        -> It is used to store data.
        -> it uses predefined template classes using including header file.

        Type of containers.
            1. Sequence Containers -> It stores data in Linear fashion. it means as a list type.
                -> Vector -> Random access fast, insertion/deletion in middle slow and Insertation at the end fast.
                -> List -> Random access slow, insertion in middle fast and insertation/deletion at the end fast.
                -> Dequeue -> Depends -> Data structure.
            2. Associative containers. -> All operations fast and Random slow.
                -> set
                -> MultiSet
                -> map
                -> multimap
            3. Derived containers. ->
                -> Queue
                -> stack
                -> priority queue
    
    2. Algorithms.
        -> Sorting.
        -> Searching.
        -> and so on.
        using predefined Template functions.

    3. Iterators.
        -> It is a object to points to an element in a container.
        -> Handled just like pointers.
        -> connects algorithms with containers.
        -> iterator moves as instructed by the algorithms.
