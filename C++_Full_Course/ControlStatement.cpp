//Notes.
    //There are Four (4) types of Control instruction in C++ Programming.
    //1. Decision Control instruction.      -> (if), (if-else), (if-else ladder), (Nested if-else)and (? - conditional operator)
    //2. Iterative Control instruction.     -> (Repeat Controls- Loops)- while loop, do while loop and for loop,
    //3. Switch case Control instruction.   -> (Switching between switch cases)- Normal Switch and Nester Switch case
    //4. Goto Control instruction.          -> (Jumbing contrls - Switch case)

    //1. ***** Decistion Control instruction. *****
    //-> It is used to perform operations based on some conditions of (if - else) instructions.
    //-> Always remember one thing .. non zero (0) value will be true in the (if) condition.

    //2. ***** Iterative Control instruction. *****
    //-> It is used to perform operations based on some condtions type of (Loops) instructions.

    //3. ***** Switch case Control instruction. *****
    //-> It is used to perform some operations based on some conditions type of (Switch case) instructions.

    //4. ***** Goto Control instruction. *****
    //-> It is used to perform some operations based on some conditions type of (Goto) instructions.
