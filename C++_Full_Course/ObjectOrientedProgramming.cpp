//Notes.
    //What is (OOPs) - Object Oriented Programming in C++ Programming ?
    //-> Works on the concept of classes and objects.
    //-> A class is a template to create objects.
    //-> Treates data as a cretical elements.
    //-> Decomposes the problem in Objects and builds data and functions around the objects.

//Basic concept for Object Oreiented Programming.
    //Classes-> Basic template for creating objects.
        //-> Classes can have Methods and properties.
        //-> Classes can make few members as private and few members as public.
        
    //Objects-> Basic runtime entities.
    //Data Abstraction & Encapsulation-> Wrapping data and functions into single Unit.
    //Inheritance-> Properties of one class can be inherited into other classes.
    //Polymorphism-> Ablity to take more than one forms.
    //Dynamic Binding-> Code which will execute is not know until the program runs.
    //Message Passing-> Object.Message(Information) call format.

//Benifits of Object Oriented Programming.
    //Better code reusability using objects and inheritance.
    //Principle of data hiding helps build secure stylesms.
    //Multiple objects can co-exist without any interference.
    //Software complexity can be easily managed.
