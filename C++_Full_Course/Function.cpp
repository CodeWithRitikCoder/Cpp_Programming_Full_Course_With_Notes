//Notes.
    //What is Function in C++ Programming ?
    //-> Function is used to divide a large C++ Prgram in to smaller pieces.
    //-> function can be called many time as per as requirments.
    //-> function provides resuability and modularity to the C++ program.
    //-> function consume memory only when its invoked and released from the RAM as soon as it's work done.
    //-> function reduce the readibility of the large and clatered code.
    //-> and Program execution will be fast using function.

//Types of function in C++ Programming .
    //There are two types of function in C++ programming.
    //1. Library function/ pre-defined function. -> which is alredy difined in the C++ library.
    //2. User defined function. -> which is created by C++ programmer.

//Nature of Functions in C++ programming.
    //There are four type of nature of function in C++ programming.
    //1. Takes nothing -- Return nothing.
    //2. Takes nothing -- Return something.
    //3. Takes something -- Return nothing.
    //4. Takes something -- Return something.

//Three things to use function in C++ programming.
    //1. Function prototype/decleration.
    //2. Function definition/body.
    //3. Function call.

    //function prototype is optional if the function body will be at the first of main function.

    //Let's code all these function on the other Cpp file.
