    //What is Variable in C++ Programming Language ?
    //-> Variable are used in C++ programming where you will need to store any type of data/ value.
    //within a program and whose value can be change during the program execution


    int a= 5, b= 10;//these are the integer variable that can store int type data items.
    cout<<"The value of a is : "<<a<<endl<<"The value of b is : "<<b<<endl;

    float c= 2.44;//this is the float variable that can store float type data items.
    cout<<"The value of c is : "<<c<<endl;

    char d= 'd';//this is the char variable that can store character value.
    cout<<"The value of d is : "<<d<<endl;

    double e= 3.5676546;//this is the double variable that can store more pointable value.
    cout<<"The value of e is : "<<e<<endl;

    bool f= true;//this is the boolean variable that can store true or false value only. or true= 1 and false= 0 and other is -1
    cout<<"The value of f is : "<<f<<endl;

    return(0);
